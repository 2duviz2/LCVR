|       Look       | Mouse Movement   | HMD              | Probably will use right joystick for snap-turning                      |

|      Crouch      | Ctrl             | right J down     | Touch here might be better, holding joysticks down is hard             |

|    SwitchItem    | ScrollY          | Right joystick Y | Its expecting an axis so this should be fine                           |
|  QEItemInteract  | Q, E             | Q = X, E = Y     | Experimental for now                                                   |
|    EnableChat    | Slash            | (Disabled)       | Chat is just not something we want to do in VR                         |

| ReloadBatteries  | R                | (Disabled)       | I have never seen batteries in this game, maybe in a future update?    |
|   InspectItem    | Z                | (Disabled)       | Only for clipboard IIRC, disabled because there's more important stuff |
|     PingScan     | RMB              | Right trigger    |                                                                        |
|   VoiceButton    | T                | (Disabled)       | IDK arbitary push to talk is not very favorable in VR                  |
|      Emote1      | 1                | (Disabled)       | Will not bother adding this into VR                                    |

|  SetFreeCamera   | C                | (Disabled)       | Most likely a developer only cheat                                     |
|    SpeedCheat    | H                | (Disabled)       | Most likely a developer only cheat                                     |

*Subject to change*

## Available controller inputs (Oculus)

> Primary button and secondary button correspond to A, B and X, Y on the left and right controller.
>
> So Y would be the left controller, secondary button.

> Menu buttons may not be accessible because they're most likely intercepted by the headset or SteamVR
